TimAble is a community-based mapping platform dedicated for people with disabilities, 
that provides inclusivity and accessibility in urban environments. This is the project of our team, `Runtime Errors`, for `UniHack 5` hackathon.

Our platform harnesses the potential of community-based content to create a comprehensive virtual map that reflects the accessibility status of different zones within the city,
contributing to a more inclusive and accessible urban environment for all.


## Inspiration

We envision a world where navigating the city is seamless for everyone, regardless of their abilities. 
We believe that the best way to achieve this is for the community to come together and share their experiences throughout the city's places and streets.


## What it would offer

- community-picked pins on the map, indicating the accessibility status of different places and streets
- a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily add new pins to the map
- admins of the platform can see statistic reports about the pins and the city's overall availability status
- in a statistics view, Timisoara's map is divided on quarters -> each quarter has an accessibility score, based on negative / positive pins submitted by the community
- the city's accessibility score is an average of all of them
- gamification for the most active users
- generated PDF files for general accessibility reports around the city
- the pins can be filtered by the accessibility type (eg. physical, visual, etc.), or by the type of the place (eg. parking) and they can be good or bad.
- **a more accessible and inclusive place for everyone**.
